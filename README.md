# ocaml-lxc
OCaml binding to LXC with idiomatic OCaml API design

**Warning**: This is still WIP, do **NOT** use it for anything serious yet

## TODO
- Test code
- API documentation + Travis CI doc build for master
- Document build flow architecture (specifically how dune fits into it maybe)
- Document code architecture

## Documentation
WIP

## Examples
WIP

## Details
#### Index
See [here](doc/INDEX.md)

#### Technical details
See [here](doc/TECH.md)

The documentation includes following aspects and is mainly useful for people looking for a case study/example
- Using cinaps for both OCaml and C code and remain consistent
- Workflow of stubs generation for C types and functions, and tying them together in dune

#### Mapping from go-lxc
ocaml-lxc has roughly the same feature set as go-lxc, and fairly similar API design

If you are familiar with go-lxc and wonder how use of go-lxc translates over here,
you can see the documentation [here](doc/GO_LXC_COMPARISON.md)

## Acknowledgement
I'd like to thank the following people for their help
- [St√©phane Graber](https://github.com/stgraber) for answering my questions w.r.t. binding and design of go-lxc
- [Jeremy Yallop](https://github.com/yallop) for answering my questions w.r.t. Ctypes

I'd also like to thank the team behind [Cinaps](https://github.com/janestreet/cinaps) for the wonderful tool,
as this project is close to impossible without its assistance.
(There are 53 function pointer fields in `lxc_container` -
writing wrapper/glue code for each manually would be exceedingly tedious and error prone.)
